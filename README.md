# Title

## Description

Use a couple of sentences to explain exactly what your project is. Don't be vague. Don't be generic. Try to say it in as simple a way as possible.

## Why

Use a paragraph or two to describe why someone should care about your project. The description section was about the "what", this is the "why". For example,

## Quick Start

This section should be the minimum amount of information they need to run your project.

## Usage

This is where you'll want to show off more of the advanced features of your project. Think of this as the larger reference manual, or the comprehensive technical documentation.
